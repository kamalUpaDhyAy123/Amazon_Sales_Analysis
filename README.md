# Amazon_Sales_Analysis

This repository contains the project I completed during my Data Analyst Internship.

## Project Overview

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate data analysis skills using Jupyter Notebook. Please check the code files, especially the `mainfilekamal`, for the core analysis and results.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of key insights
- Use of Python and Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Getting Started

To explore the analysis:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamalUpaDhyAy123/data-anayst.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder and launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd data-anayst
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open and run the notebooks, especially `mainfilekamal`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data analysis libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

- ![Amazon Sales Analysis Demo](?raw=true)
